# DesertPy Data Science Talk

The plan for the talk, or if you're reading online, is to start with the folder called "numpy_talk" and interactively type through some example commands in the file "numpy_outline.py" to get started. The other codes in that directory are examples using numpy and scipy and scikit-learn to do some tasks, and image files showing resulting plots are in that directory too.

Next, the plan is to talk about fitting linear and non-linear functions to data. It's statistics, or an example of supervised machine learning, either perspective is fine by me! :) Anyway, the plan was to go to the emcee_mcmc_and_fitting_talk folder and start with my handwritten theoretical notes in "fitting_notes_sean_bryan.pdf" and then move on the example in "mcmc_example.py" to watch how non-linear fitting works in a simple example. Then, the plan is to go to the us_population_logistic_fit directory and use the emcee package to fit the US population growth history over time, as an illustration of the emcee algorithm and how useful that is.
